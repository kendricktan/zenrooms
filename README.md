# ZenRooms

This is just a prove of concept, building a secure chatroom application on top of zencash's blockchain.

Might be quite buggy.

NOTE: Sending a message and Adding a room takes a long time.

# Getting started
1. Edit `config.json` and enter your rpc username, password, host, and port obtained from `zen.conf`.
2. Make sure `zen.conf` has a line `server=1`.
3. Run `zenrooms`
```bash
yarn install
yarn run
```
4. (Optional) Add my room (Private Key: `SKxtHJsneoLByrwME9Nh4cd4AvYLNK9jJkAnB3AHNW794udD1qpx`). Please don't steal the 0.0000004 ZEN. They're worth <1 cent as of 2017/08/19.
